# TODO

## Cheat sheet, just if you forget:
- [ ] Empty
- [x] Checked
- [-] Discarted

## High level stuff


## Planning and design

- [ ] Model the game structures
  - [ ] Whiteboard the game, laying out the whole structure 
  - [ ] Find all the nouns
  - [ ] Determine what each noun can do and wether it's valid or not
- [ ] Deterine a game structure that keeps track of the game and show the score (remember it doesn't take actions)
- [ ] Determine 

Whiteboard it, lay out the whole structure then start coding the modules
On top of all that simulate the game, but you need to actually receive actions from he player and communicate the action of the player
Probably can make the game first, game is composed of a bunch of rules and you check that the whole game is valid, you test individual parts, no need to have a whole E2E test of all

From that you move to the UI design, consider the graphical capabilities of the CLI
Also create AI players (randomly, or how?), you have to know what is a good reaction to something, called even design multiple AI characters
First make the game work, then make it playable

# BACKLOG

- [ ] Set up a CI/CD structure on github with clippy as a mandatory step
- [ ] Listen to Zelda's final summary of the game on the recording
- [ ] Define a design and architecture
- [ ] Code the modules from the nouns
