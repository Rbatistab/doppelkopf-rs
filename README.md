Me too, which is why I bring you this open source version of [doppelkopf game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppelkopf) (grug sees public domain game, grug sees no lawsuits, grub develops)

Doppelkopf is a popular card game in Germany, family of the "trick-tacking" games. This game is played with a double deck of cards with three variants according to the number of players:
* 8 players: 2 x 32 (*Type I*) 
* 6 players: 2 x 24 (*Type H*)
* 4 players: 2 x 20 cards (*Type G*)

Also, since Doppelkopf is german it's easy as hell to understand the rules, just like german language.
