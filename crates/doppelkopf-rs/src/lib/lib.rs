//! This library provides the resources to implement a dopplekopf game.
//!
//! To create your game you'll have the following resources:
//!   1. `core_logic`, provides all the utils with the core logic to handle a doppelkopf game
//!   2. `model`, has the types and operations
//!   3. `utils`, TBD
//!
//! # Examples:
//! ## 1. A CLI implementation:
//! ```
//! use dppkf_lib::core_logic;
//! // Example in progress!
//! ```
pub mod core_logic;
